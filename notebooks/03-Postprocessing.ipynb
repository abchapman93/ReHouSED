Some reasons for this include templates (e.g., questionnaire's which contain housing-related terms but don't actually contain useful information), complex linguistic structures, and the actual complexity involved in defining what someone's housing status is. Now that we've extracted concepts and set some important attributes, the next component implements complex, highly specific, and sometimes brittle logic through **postprocessing**."

    "This rule was one of the most difficult to implement and probably one of the main causes of false negatives in the paper. The basic motivation for this is that similar to the world **\"housing\"**, words like **\"house\"** and  **\"apartment\"** are often not specifically referring to the patient's housing. So to avoid false positives, we may want to ignore these phrases. However, there are obviously many scenarios in which these entities are very specifically about the patient. So this rule tries to make distincitons between these two scenarios by looking for contextual information. For example:\n",
    "- **\"maintain her apartment\"** implies that the patient is living in an apartment\n",
    "- **\"applied to an apartment\"** implies that the patient is trying to get housing\n",
    "- **\"his own house**\" implies a patient has a house\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule works by checking for each of these variations which indicate a mention is relevant, and if none of the conditions are met, the entity is set to be ignored. (So unlike the previous rule we looked at, if this rule passes the entity is ignored.)  However, the problem is that it's very difficult/impossible the enumerate and capture all the different situations in which an entity should be considered relevant. When the NLP misses such a situation, this can cause a false negative.\n",
