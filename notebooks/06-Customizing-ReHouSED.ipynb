    "# Appendix. Customizing ReHouSED NLP\n",
    "Like any clinical NLP system, the performance of this model will vary greatly based on your data and specific task. The system implemented in this package is an approximation of what was used in the manuscript, but was modified to be more general and remove any specific references to VA documentation practices. If you apply this to a new dataset, you will need to modify the system based on your EHR, the language used in clinical documents, and changed definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources files\n",
    "The majority of logic for the system is contained in the `resources` directory: `rehoused/resources/*`. Each of these files will contain rules corresponding to one of the components described in the notebook. They will mostly be `.py` files, although many rules can also be stored as `.json`. files (the exception being `postprocessing` rules and rules which use more advanced callback functions). The subfolder `target_rules` will each contain rules for different entity classes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "- rehoused/\n",
    "    - resources/\n",
    "        - target_rules/\n",

    "## Loading rules\n",
    "The helper function `rehoused_nlp.utils.build_nlp()` handles instantiating the NLP pipeline and adding rules, but you can always manually load a model and add rules yourselves (again, see medspaCy for more examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding rules programatically\n",
    "The best way to customize rules is to edit or create resource files like the ones listed above. But you can also add them directly to pipeline components. Each of the examples below will show how to add a rule to one of the components we discussed."
